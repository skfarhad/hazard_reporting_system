# How to contribute
I appreciate your valuable input! Let's build a community that cares for the natural disaster affected people of Bangladesh.
<br>I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

### [Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) will be maintained. So, all contributions will be integrated through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. I will be actively looking for your pull requests:

- Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
- Issue that pull request!


## Reporting bugs
Let's use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/skfarhad/hazard_reporting_system/issues).

#### Write bug reports with detailed summery and sample code. Great bug reports tend to have-

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [This bug report](https://github.com/matplotlib/mplfinance/issues/394) 
includes sample code that *anyone* with standard Python setup can run to reproduce the issue.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a consistent coding style

* Try to follow [standard Python coding practices](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and
[Standard TS best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/best-practices-cdk-typescript-iac/typescript-best-practices.html)
* Use multiple lines for specifying more than 3 parameters in functions
* Don't use more than 80 characters in a single line of code
* Use descriptive variable names


## Feature requests
Feature requests are highly appreciated. I would love to hear about how you might use this tool in your professional/research work.
<b>  [The project issue tracker](https://github.com/skfarhad/hazard_reporting_system/issues) can be used for feature requests also.

- Provide the specific use cases of the requested features in details
- You may also suggest slight enhancements of existing features
- Mention how these features add value to your profession/research work
